Summary: Easy to use audio stem separation from the command line or as a dependency in your own Python project, using the amazing MDX-Net, VR Arch, Demucs and MDXC models available in UVR by @Anjok07 & @aufr33.

Audio Separator is a Python package that allows you to separate an audio file into various stems, using models trained by @Anjok07 for use with UVR (<https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui>).

The simplest (and probably most used) use case for this package is to separate an audio file into two stems, Instrumental and Vocals, which can be very useful for producing karaoke videos! However, the models available in UVR can separate audio into many more stems, such as Drums, Bass, Piano, and Guitar, and perform other audio processing tasks, such as denoising or removing echo/reverb.

## Features

- Separate audio into multiple stems, e.g. instrumental and vocals.
- Supports all common audio formats (WAV, MP3, FLAC, M4A, etc.)
- Ability to inference using a pre-trained model in PTH or ONNX format.
- CLI support for easy use in scripts and batch processing.
- Python API for integration into other projects.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### üê≥ Docker

If you're able to use docker, you don't actually need to _install_ anything - there are [images published on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/beveradb/audio-separator/tags) for GPU (CUDA) and CPU inferencing, for both `amd64` and `arm64` platforms.

You probably want to volume-mount a folder containing whatever file you want to separate, which can then also be used as the output folder.

For instance, if your current directory has the file `input.wav`, you could execute `audio-separator` as shown below (see [usage](#usage-) section for more details):

```sh
docker run -it -v `pwd`:/workdir beveradb/audio-separator input.wav
```

If you're using a machine with a GPU, you'll want to use the GPU specific image and pass in the GPU device to the container, like this:

```sh
docker run -it --gpus all -v `pwd`:/workdir beveradb/audio-separator:gpu input.wav
```

If the GPU isn't being detected, make sure your docker runtime environment is passing through the GPU correctly - there are [various guides](https://www.celantur.com/blog/run-cuda-in-docker-on-linux/) online to help with that.

### üéÆ Nvidia GPU with CUDA or üß™ Google Colab

**Supported CUDA Versions:** 11.8 and 12.2

üí¨ If successfully configured, you should see this log message when running `audio-separator --env_info`:
 `ONNXruntime has CUDAExecutionProvider available, enabling acceleration`

Conda: `conda install pytorch=*=*cuda* onnxruntime=*=*cuda* audio-separator -c pytorch -c conda-forge`

Pip: `pip install "audio-separator[gpu]"`

Docker: `beveradb/audio-separator:gpu`

### Ô£ø Apple Silicon, macOS Sonoma+ with M1 or newer CPU (CoreML acceleration)

üí¨ If successfully configured, you should see this log message when running `audio-separator --env_info`:
 `ONNXruntime has CoreMLExecutionProvider available, enabling acceleration`

Pip: `pip install "audio-separator[cpu]"`

### üê¢ No hardware acceleration, CPU only

Conda: `conda install audio-separator-c pytorch -c conda-forge`

Pip: `pip install "audio-separator[cpu]"`

Docker: `beveradb/audio-separator`

### üé• FFmpeg dependency

üí¨ To test if `audio-separator` has been successfully configured to use FFmpeg, run `audio-separator --env_info`. The log will show `FFmpeg installed`.

If you installed `audio-separator` using `conda` or `docker`, FFmpeg should already be available in your environment.

You may need to separately install FFmpeg. It should be easy to install on most platforms, e.g.:

üêß Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get update; apt-get install -y ffmpeg`

Ô£ø macOS:`brew update; brew install ffmpeg`

## GPU / CUDA specific installation steps with Pip

In theory, all you should need to do to get `audio-separator` working with a GPU is install it with the `[gpu]` extra as above.

However, sometimes getting both PyTorch and ONNX Runtime working with CUDA support can be a bit tricky so it may not work that easily.

You may need to reinstall both packages directly, allowing pip to calculate the right versions for your platform, for example:

- `pip uninstall torch onnxruntime`
- `pip cache purge`
- `pip install --force-reinstall torch torchvision torchaudio`
- `pip install --force-reinstall onnxruntime-gpu`

I generally recommend installing the latest version of PyTorch for your environment using the command recommended by the wizard here:
<https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>

### Multiple CUDA library versions may be needed

Depending on your CUDA version and environment, you may need to install specific version(s) of CUDA libraries for ONNX Runtime to use your GPU.

üß™ Google Colab, for example, now uses CUDA 12 by default, but ONNX Runtime still needs CUDA 11 libraries to work.

If you see the error `Failed to load library` or `cannot open shared object file` when you run `audio-separator`, this is likely the issue.

You can install the CUDA 11 libraries _alongside_ CUDA 12 like so:
`apt update; apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit`

If you encounter the following messages when running on Google Colab or in another environment:
```
[E:onnxruntime:Default, provider_bridge_ort.cc:1862 TryGetProviderInfo_CUDA] /onnxruntime_src/onnxruntime/core/session/provider_bridge_ort.cc:1539 onnxruntime::Provider& onnxruntime::ProviderLibrary::Get() [ONNXRuntimeError] : 1 : FAIL : Failed to load library libonnxruntime_providers_cuda.so with error: libcudnn_adv.so.9: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

[W:onnxruntime:Default, onnxruntime_pybind_state.cc:993 CreateExecutionProviderInstance] Failed to create CUDAExecutionProvider. Require cuDNN 9.* and CUDA 12.*. Please install all dependencies as mentioned in the GPU requirements page (https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/CUDA-ExecutionProvider.html#requirements), make sure they're in the PATH, and that your GPU is supported.
```
You can resolve this by running the following command:
```sh
python -m pip install ort-nightly-gpu --index-url=https://aiinfra.pkgs.visualstudio.com/PublicPackages/_packaging/ort-cuda-12-nightly/pypi/simple/
```

> Note: if anyone knows how to make this cleaner so we can support both different platform-specific dependencies for hardware acceleration without a separate installation process for each, please let me know or raise a PR!

## Usage üöÄ

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

You can use Audio Separator via the command line, for example:

```sh
audio-separator /path/to/your/input/audio.wav --model_filename UVR-MDX-NET-Inst_HQ_3.onnx
```

This command will download the specified model file, process the `audio.wav` input audio and generate two new files in the current directory, one containing vocals and one containing instrumental.

**Note:** You do not need to download any files yourself - audio-separator does that automatically for you!

To see a list of supported models, run `audio-separator --list_models`

Any file listed in the list models output can be specified (with file extension) with the model_filename parameter (e.g. `--model_filename UVR_MDXNET_KARA_2.onnx`) and it will be automatically downloaded to the `--model_file_dir` (default: `/tmp/audio-separator-models/`) folder on first usage.

### As a Dependency in a Python Project

You can use Audio Separator in your own Python project. Here's a minimal example using the default two stem (Instrumental and Vocals) model:

```python
from audio_separator.separator import Separator

# Initialize the Separator class (with optional configuration properties, below)
separator = Separator()

# Load a machine learning model (if unspecified, defaults to 'model_mel_band_roformer_ep_3005_sdr_11.4360.ckpt')
separator.load_model()

# Perform the separation on specific audio files without reloading the model
output_files = separator.separate('audio1.wav')

print(f"Separation complete! Output file(s): {' '.join(output_files)}")
```

#### Batch processing and processing with multiple models

You can process multiple files without reloading the model to save time and memory.

You only need to load a model when choosing or changing models. See example below:

```python
from audio_separator.separator import Separator

# Initialize the Separator with other configuration properties, below
separator = Separator()

# Load a model
separator.load_model(model_filename='UVR-MDX-NET-Inst_HQ_3.onnx')

# Separate multiple audio files without reloading the model
output_file_paths_1 = separator.separate('audio1.wav')
output_file_paths_2 = separator.separate('audio2.wav')
output_file_paths_3 = separator.separate('audio3.wav')

# Load a different model
separator.load_model(model_filename='UVR_MDXNET_KARA_2.onnx')

# Separate the same files with the new model
output_file_paths_4 = separator.separate('audio1.wav')
output_file_paths_5 = separator.separate('audio2.wav')
output_file_paths_6 = separator.separate('audio3.wav')
```

#### Renaming Stems

You can rename the output files by specifying the desired names. For example:
```python
output_files = separator.separate('audio1.wav', 'stem1', 'stem2')
```
In this case, the output file names will be: `stem1.wav` and `stem2.wav`.

You can also rename specific stems:

- To rename the primary stem:
  ```python
  output_files = separator.separate('audio1.wav', primary_output_name='stem1')
  ```
  > The output files will be named: `stem1.wav` and `audio1_(Instrumental)_model_mel_band_roformer_ep_3005_sdr_11.wav`
- To rename the secondary stem:
  ```python
  output_files = separator.separate('audio1.wav', secondary_output_name='stem2')
  ```
  > The output files will be named: `audio1_(Vocals)_model_mel_band_roformer_ep_3005_sdr_11.wav` and `stem2.wav`

## Requirements üìã

Python >= 3.10

Libraries: torch, onnx, onnxruntime, numpy, librosa, requests, six, tqdm, pydub

## Developing Locally

This project uses Poetry for dependency management and packaging. Follow these steps to setup a local development environment:

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Python 3.10 or newer installed on your machine.
- Install Conda (I recommend Miniforge: <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>) to manage your Python virtual environments

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/audio-separator.git
cd audio-separator
```

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username if you've forked the repository, or use the main repository URL if you have the permissions.

### Create and activate the Conda Environment

To create and activate the conda environment, use the following commands:

```sh
conda env create
conda activate audio-separator-dev
```

### Install Dependencies

Once you're inside the conda env, run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```sh
poetry install
```

Install extra dependencies depending if you're running with GPU or CPU.
```sh
poetry install --extras "cpu"
```
or
```sh
poetry install --extras "gpu"
```

### Running the Command-Line Interface Locally

You can run the CLI command directly within the virtual environment. For example:

```sh
audio-separator path/to/your/audio-file.wav
```

### Deactivate the Virtual Environment

Once you are done with your development work, you can exit the virtual environment by simply typing:

```sh
conda deactivate
```

### Building the Package

To build the package for distribution, use the following command:

```sh
poetry build
```

This will generate the distribution packages in the dist directory - but for now only @beveradb will be able to publish to PyPI.


## How to Use the in Colab 

1. **Link Input**:

![step 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edb41e74-2082-43d8-9dde-30cc4eee3423)


   - **video_url**: This input is where you paste the URL of the audio or video you want to download. It can be from various platforms supported by yt-dlp. For a full list of supported websites, refer to [this link](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md).

   - Example: 
     ``` 
     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exampleID 
     ```

2. **Input Audio File for Separation**:

![2 and 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a040a17f-dad1-447a-afef-39fbbe59e556)


   - **input**: This is the file path of the audio you want to separate. After downloading the audio file, you will need to specify this path to continue with separation.

   - Example:
     ``` 
     /content/ytdl/your_downloaded_audio.wav 
     ```

3. **Output Directory**:
   - **output**: This is the path where the separated files will be saved. It defaults to `/content/output` but can be changed to another directory if desired.

   - Example:
     ``` 
     /content/custom_output 
     ```
